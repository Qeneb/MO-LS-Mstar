# MO-LS-M*
This a repository about MO-LS-M* which is an algorithm to solve Multi-Objective Multi-Agent Path Finding with Asynchronous Action (MOMAPF-AA) problem. 

The corresponding article is [Multi-Objective Loosely Synchronized Search for Multi-Objective Multi-Agent Path Finding with Asynchronous Actions](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12204-024-2744-x)

`run_exmaple.py` is the entry of the algorithm. 

`demo.py` is used to generate a demo video like this:
